# OpenAI Node.js Chatbot

This is a simple Node.js script that uses the OpenAI API to take user input and display AI-generated responses in the command line. It uses the `openai` client library to interact with the API and `readline` to handle user input.

## Prerequisites

- Node.js (version 14.x or higher recommended)
- An OpenAI API key

## Installation

1. **Clone the repository** (if you have it hosted somewhere) or create a new directory and initialize a Node.js project:

   ```bash
   mkdir openai-chatbot
   cd openai-chatbot
   npm init -y
   ```

2. **Install the required npm packages**:

   ```bash
   npm install openai readline
   ```

3. **Add your OpenAI API key**:

   Replace `'YOUR_API_KEY_HERE'` in the `app.js` file with your actual OpenAI API key.

## Usage

1. **Save the script** provided in the `app.js` file.

2. **Run the script** using Node.js:

   ```bash
   node app.js
   ```

3. **Interact with the chatbot**:

   Type your messages into the command line and press `Enter`. The AI will respond to your inputs.

4. **Exit the script**:

   Press `Ctrl+C` to stop the script.

## Example

```
You: Hello!
AI: Hi there! How can I assist you today?

You: What's the weather like?
AI: I don't have real-time weather information, but you can check a weather website or app for the latest updates.
```

## Troubleshooting

- **API Key Errors**: Ensure that you have a valid OpenAI API key and that it's correctly placed in the `app.js` file.
- **Network Issues**: Ensure that your internet connection is stable and that you can reach the OpenAI API endpoints.
