### Chatbot
This is a simple Node.js script that uses the OpenAI API to take user input and display AI-generated responses in the command line. It uses the `openai` client library to interact with the API and `readline` to handle user input.
*********************************************************************************************
## Steps

1. **Install the required npm packages**:
   - `openai` (the official OpenAI client library)
   - `readline` (for taking user input from the command line)
   - 
   ```bash
   npm install openai readline
   ```

2. **Create a Node.js script**:
This code should contain the OpenAI API key.

4. **Run the script**:

   ```bash
   node app.js
   ```
